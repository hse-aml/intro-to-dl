    "# Here're the notes for those who want to play around here\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips on what you could do:\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Network size__\n",
    "   * More neurons, \n",
    "   * More layers, ([docs](https://keras.io/))\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Other nonlinearities in the hidden layers\n",
    "     * tanh, relu, leaky relu, etc\n",
    "   * Larger networks may take more epochs to train, so don't discard your net just because it could didn't beat the baseline in 5 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Early Stopping__\n",
    "   * Training for 100 epochs regardless of anything is probably a bad idea.\n",
    "   * Some networks converge over 5 epochs, others - over 500.\n",
    "   * Way to go: stop when validation score is 10 iterations past maximum\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    " * __Faster optimization__\n",
    "   * rmsprop, nesterov_momentum, adam, adagrad and so on.\n",
    "     * Converge faster and sometimes reach better optima\n",
    "     * It might make sense to tweak learning rate/momentum, other learning parameters, batch size and number of epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " * __Regularize__ to prevent overfitting\n",
    "   * Add some L2 weight norm to the loss function, theano will do the rest\n",
    "     * Can be done manually or via - https://keras.io/regularizers/\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    " * __Data augmemntation__ - getting 5x as large dataset for free is a great deal\n",
    "   * https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/\n",
    "   * Zoom-in+slice = move\n",
    "   * Rotate+zoom(to remove black stripes)\n",
    "   * any other perturbations\n",
    "   * Simple way to do that (if you have PIL/Image): \n",
    "     * ```from scipy.misc import imrotate,imresize```\n",
    "     * and a few slicing\n",
    "   * Stay realistic. There's usually no point in flipping dogs upside down as that is not the way you usually see them."
