    "  * You can also use 1D Convolutions (`keras.layers.Conv1D`). They are often as good as recurrent layers but with less overfitting.\n",
    "* __Stack more layers__: if there is a common motif to this course it's about stacking layers\n",
    "  * You can just add recurrent and 1dconv layers on top of one another and keras will understand it\n",
    "  * Just remember that bigger networks may need more epochs to train\n",
    "* __Gradient clipping__: If your training isn't as stable as you'd like, set `clipnorm` in your optimizer.\n",
    "  * Which is to say, it's a good idea to watch over your loss curve at each minibatch. Try tensorboard callback or something similar.\n",
    "* __Regularization__: you can apply dropouts as usuall but also in an RNN-specific way\n",
    "  * `keras.layers.Dropout` works inbetween RNN layers\n",
    "  * Recurrent layers also have `recurrent_dropout` parameter\n",
    "* __More words!__: You can obtain greater performance by expanding your model's input dictionary from 5000 to up to every single word!\n",
    "  * Just make sure your model doesn't overfit due to so many parameters.\n",
    "  * Combined with regularizers or pre-trained word-vectors this could be really good cuz right now our model is blind to >5% of words.\n",
    "* __The most important advice__: don't cram in everything at once!\n",
    "  * If you stuff in a lot of modiffications, some of them almost inevitably gonna be detrimental and you'll never know which of them are.\n",
    "  * Try to instead go in small iterations and record experiment results to guide further search.\n",

    "Here there are a few more tips on how to improve training that are a bit trickier to impliment. We strongly suggest that you try them _after_ you've got a good initial model.\n",
    "* __Use pre-trained embeddings__: you can use pre-trained weights from [there](http://ahogrammer.com/2017/01/20/the-list-of-pretrained-word-embeddings/) to kickstart your Embedding layer.\n",
    "  * Embedding layer has a matrix W (layer.W) which contains word embeddings for each word in the dictionary. You can just overwrite them with tf.assign.\n",
    "  * When using pre-trained embeddings, pay attention to the fact that model's dictionary is different from your own.\n",
    "  * You may want to switch trainable=False for embedding layer in first few epochs as in regular fine-tuning.  \n",
    "* __More efficient batching__: right now TF spends a lot of time iterating over \"0\"s\n",
    "  * This happens because batch is always padded to the length of a longest sentence\n",
    "  * You can speed things up by pre-generating batches of similar lengths and feeding it with randomly chosen pre-generated batch.\n",
    "  * This technically breaks the i.i.d. assumption, but it works unless you come up with some insane rnn architectures.\n",
    "* __Structured loss functions__: since we're tagging the whole sequence at once, we might as well train our network to do so.\n",
    "  * There's more than one way to do so, but we'd recommend starting with [Conditional Random Fields](http://blog.echen.me/2012/01/03/introduction-to-conditional-random-fields/)\n",
    "  * You could plug CRF as a loss function and still train by backprop. There's even some neat tensorflow [implementation](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_guides/python/contrib.crf) for you.\n"
